- **Classes**: Understanding how to create and use classes in Java.
- **Data Types**: Exploring different data types and their applications.
- **Eclipse**: Utilizing the Eclipse IDE for Java development.
- **Error Handling**: Implementing error handling techniques to manage exceptions.
- **Inheritance**: Learning about inheritance and its role in OOP.
- **Java**: Core Java programming concepts and syntax.
- **JavaFX**: Creating graphical user interfaces with JavaFX.
- **Maps**: Using maps to store and manipulate data.
- **OOP**: Applying Object-Oriented Programming principles.
- **PHP**: Basic understanding of PHP for web development.
- **Regex**: Using regular expressions for pattern matching.
- **SQL**: Interacting with databases using SQL.

## Getting Started

To get started with the projects in this repository, follow the steps below. Each project may have its own requirements, so be sure to check the individual folders for specific instructions.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   To clone the repository, use the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amarenderreddy123/Java-Programming-I-and-II.git
   ```

2. **Open in Eclipse**:
   Open Eclipse and import the cloned project. Navigate to `File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace`, then select the directory where you cloned the repository.

3. **Set Up Java**:
   Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. You can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

## Usage

Once you have set up the repository in Eclipse, you can run the individual Java files. Each assignment folder contains a main class that you can execute to see the results. 

For example, to run a specific assignment, locate the main class file in the folder, right-click it, and select `Run As > Java Application`.

## Examples

### Class Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of a class in Java:

```java
public class Dog {
    String name;

    public Dog(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void bark() {
        System.out.println(name + " says Woof!");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog myDog = new Dog("Buddy");
        myDog.bark();
    }
}
```

### Error Handling Example

Hereâ€™s an example demonstrating error handling:

```java
public class ErrorHandlingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int result = 10 / 0;
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero.");
        }
    }
}
```
